> A no-frills web version of the classic snakes and ladders board game. Check it out over [here](https://heuristic-jang-27db68.netlify.app/#/snakes-and-ladders/game-select).

## Highlights

- Built using AngularJS. I had created this years ago when AngularJS was the rage, thought why not add it on the GitHub repo 🤷🏼‍♂️.
- Play against computer or against a fellow human.
